		"para1": "Gadge Maharaj was a saint who had a clear understanding of who God was and who worked tirelessly to eradicate ignorance, superstition and impurity for the material and spiritual upliftment of the deprived and destitute. Gadgebaba was a famous saint who helped the downtrodden, underprivileged, orphans and disabled. Taking donations from the public, this saint who sought God in man started dharamshalas, orphanages, ashrams and schools for orphans at various places across Maharashtra. The deprived, the weak, and the orphan were his deities. Gadgebaba was the most fond of these deitiesand believed <strong>everyone has the right to live a healthy, clean and happy life.</strong>",
		"para2": "Gadge Maharaj was a social reformer who fought to eradicate ignorance, superstition and filth among the underprivileged and destitute. Following into his footsteps, <strong>Mrs. Vaishali Nemade</strong> and her husband and inspiration <strong>Mr. Kundan Premchand Nemade's Parisparsh Multipurpose Foundation's</strong>  has become a support center for many elderly people in the last three years.",
		"para3": "Through Premkunj Old Age Home, from children who are separated from their babies to neglected victims of physical and mental violence, widowed women and senior citizens have got a great helping hand. A major complaint that most all elderly people have is limb pain, some have paralysis. Today, all the elderly live here in great joy and enthusiasm and live their life to their heart's content. Forgetting all the sorrows of life, they laugh, play, have fun. So much so that they treat us as their children and even wish to die here. We try our best to provide them with all the physical facilities we can afford.",
		"para4": "But while doing all this hard work we do face a lot of financial difficulties. We sincerely hope that you also take care of us, understand our needs from time to time and provide appropriate help, especially doctors and hospitals. It is really a shame that parents who spend seventy to seventy thousand rupees a year on their children for school and classes alone are not ready to spend seven hundred rupees for their parents. In the land of debt-ridden suicides and starving people, thousands of rupees are spent on birthdays, two or three cakes are cut and wasted, but in the case of poor parents, there is <strong>no time to think</strong>. Schools, colleges, picnics or study tours go to expensive resorts, but we are not convinced or embarrassed to inculcate and maintain the culture of serving the elderly. We spend more than 85% of our own personal income in serving the people of our Ashram. People call our work madness, but how can we explain it to sensible and happy people in a practical sense that we find a different kind of joy in this madness. Only your initiative will create awareness among people about this kind of work and we are absolutely sure of it.",
		"para5": "<strong>God is not in temples but in the service of the animals, the poor and the weak and the elderly. If there is God anywhere on earth it's in the form of parents.</strong> This is our clear perception. It is not possible to repay the favors and sanskars of parents. No one can and will never be able to love their children as selflessly as parents.",
		"para6": "We need many materials for the smooth running of the ashram and your help is urgently needed. We need about fifty cots and mattresses, beds, refrigerators, coolers, at least one AC system in public rooms, at least 40ltr/hr water purifier, at least two buckets for senior citizens, as well as food grains. Keeping in mind the seriousness of this matter, as a member of the society, it is a humble request that you help as soon as possible and as much as possible. Many old people will benefit from this invaluable help of yours.",
		"para7": "Our organization is a registered organization and taxable persons get financial relief of 80G on annual income as per income tax rules. <strong>The world will change only if you change your thinking. Instill good values in children otherwise the same could happen to you someday.</strong>",
